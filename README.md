focuses on a specific font (provided by Google Fonts), allowing users to download dynamically
generated sheets on the fly.

- Fonts are dynamically fetched and loaded from Google's Font API
    - Fonts are converted to base64 and placed in the PDF as needed.
- Page sentences can be dynamically generated as needed, or typed in by users
